"""
cco/isolate.py — run a submitted kernel in an ISOLATED subprocess so it cannot forge its score.

THE THREAT. The submitted kernel runs with full Python privileges. If it shares an interpreter
with the scorer, it can read the secret input seed from `sys.argv`, monkeypatch `torch.allclose` /
the comparison / the timing events / even the no-delegation trap, or execute arbitrary code at
import (a repo-root `sitecustomize.py`, `os.system`, ...). An in-process guard cannot stop this —
the attacker is already inside the interpreter.

THE FIX. Move every TRUSTED operation into the PARENT, and run only `kernel_fn` in a clean child:

    parent: generate ALL stage inputs from the secret seed (NEVER sent to the child)
        │  serialize the input TENSORS (not the seed) to a temp file
        ▼
    child : python -E, clean cwd, kernel loaded by file path (no sys.path injection, no
            sitecustomize), runs kernel_fn under the dispatch trap on each input, times the scored
            size with CUDA events, and writes back the OUTPUT TENSORS it produced
        │
        ▼
    parent: validates EVERY returned output against ITS OWN oracle (the child's comparison is never
            trusted) across the full correctness suite — smoke, shape sweep (all sizes × dtypes),
            numerical stability, determinism, edge cases — plus the scored-size buffers checked
            before AND after the timed window. Timing is bounded by the parent's wall-clock.

What this CLOSES: in-process correctness forgery, seed-read, scorer-state monkeypatching, the
sitecustomize / PYTHON* / os.system paths affecting the verdict, OOM/crash on a locked size (= a
stage FAIL), garbage-on-replay, and memoize-and-replay (incl. the padded variant). The timed loop
mutates its input before every call so a content cache must recompute (honest timing); a parent
oracle-checks a kernel-unknowable sample of timed outputs so a pointer cache returning a stale answer
is caught; and an absolute roofline floor rejects any physically-impossible median. The child trap is
defense-in-depth; the load-bearing checks are the parent's oracle over the whole suite + the floor.

Cost of the mutation: one extra Triton-store launch per timed call adds a small, FIXED latency
(launch overhead, exposed only for very fast kernels). It is identical for the champion and the
challenger, so the relative win test is unbiased; it slightly raises the minimum *detectable*
improvement, which also damps crown-thrash on negligible wins.

Residual (documented): a kernel that is genuinely correct but under-reports its CUDA-event timing
from inside the child. The parent wall-clock tripwire + roofline floor reject the impossible cases
(claimed GPU time > wall, or below the hardware bound); full immunity needs parent-driven two-point
wall-clock timing, a follow-up.

Usage (needs a CUDA GPU + torch/triton; run in the Linux/WSL env):
